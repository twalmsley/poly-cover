# Polygon to Rectangles

Draw polygons and cover their interior with a minimal set of axis-aligned squares.

**To run:** Unzip the release and serve the folder (e.g. `npx serve .`) or open `index.html` via a local web server. The app needs to be served over HTTP; opening the file directly may not work due to module loading.

See the [README](https://github.com/twalmsley/poly-cover#readme) for full usage and controls.
